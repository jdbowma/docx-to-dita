# docx-to-dita
A Python script/app to convert .docx to DITA XML format. It is currently in its extremely early alpha phase and is considered extremely unreliable and unstable.

Currently only supports steps (no substeps) in a task topic. It relies upon steps being in a numbered (ordered) list for now. 

Available in both GUI and CLI versions.
